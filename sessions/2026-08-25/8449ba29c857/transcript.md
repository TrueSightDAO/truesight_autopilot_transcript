Hey Gary — I did the digging before answering: I searched this thread's history, the past 30 days of session transcripts, the full context repo, and org-wide code for anything anchored to "keep searching" or this thread — and honestly, there's nothing in my context that tells me what "keep searching" is pointing at. This thread (14320) starts fresh for me; I have no prior turns here to continue from.

What I *did* surface as the closest open "search"-adjacent item: the Cacao Tea 50g QR batch from the 20th — the VOID serial `2024OSCAR_CT_20260820_3` (replaced by `_101`) is documented as informational-only in OPEN_FOLLOWUPS, so there's nothing pending there.

Can you re-point me — what should I keep searching on? A product/Amazon re-verify, a partner lookup, a web search, or something else? One keyword and I'm on it.


### 🧑 Governor

[Telegram context: chat_id=-1003919341801, thread_id=14320] I'm thinking probably in the future when all LLMs or any LLMs do a class push, we should probably have a location where they lock their pushes, what do you think? Probably, perhaps log it as a record on GitHub somewhere, think about this and let me know. [System note: the user sent this as a VOICE message via the Telegram bot.

Good idea, Gary — and I've already dug through what we have, so here's my honest take.

**What already exists (the partial answer):**
- **Git history per repo** — every code push goes through a branch + PR, so git itself is a per-repo audit trail.
- **`Version.gs`** in every clasp mirror — deploy time + changelog survive in the Apps Script project.
- **`CONTEXT_UPDATES.md`** — an append-only human log where agents already jot one line per change. It's the informal version of what you're describing, but it's prose, not machine-checkable.

**The real gap** — there's no *single, cross-agent, cross-target* record: who pushed, to which GAS scriptId / host / repo, when, with what result. Two LLMs could both clasp-push the same scriptId today and neither would know. That's the collision you're worried about.

**What I'd build:**
1. **One ledger on GitHub** — I'd extend `ecosystem_change_logs` (it already has the right pattern: Markdown + YAML frontmatter + JSON feed) into a general "push/deploy ledger" with a `deploys/` section, rather than spawning another repo.
2. **Each entry**: agent identity (from the agents registry — Sophia, Deep Seek, Envoy, Bionpact), UTC timestamp, target (scriptId / host / repo+branch), action type (clasp push, autopilot deploy, beta→prod sync, npm publish), commit refs, result, evidence URL.
3. **The "lock" part is the key**: before any push, the agent writes an **in-progress lease entry** for that target; if a lease already exists with no result and a short TTL, the push is refused — wait or alert. After the push, the same entry is updated to success/failure. Git merges already serialize themselves; this closes the gap for the pushes that bypass git — GAS, EC2 deploys, prod syncs.
4. **Enforcement**: wire it into the existing `gas_deploy_project` tool and my own deploy/sync flows — dry-run shows the lease check, real run acquires it. Later it can surface on truesight.me like the Beer Hall feed already does.

Biggest design decision for you: **lease + TTL lock** (agent must write before pushing, so a crashed push releases after TTL) vs **pure append-only log** (no locking, just an after-the-fact record). I'd start with the log + a soft lease since it's cheap and honest.

Want me to write this up as a proper plan file and scaffold the ledger repo + the pre-flight check as a PR? That'd be my natural next step — just say go.
