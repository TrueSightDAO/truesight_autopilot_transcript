**Session**: `a3db3250c3b8`

**Governor**: Gary Teh

### 🧑 Governor

 You are speaking with Gary Teh. When they say 'I', 'me', or 'my', they mean Gary Teh.]

[Telegram context: chat_id=-1003919341801, thread_id=11596] https://beta.dapp.truesight.me/link_tree_planting.html format of UX should be standardized as with other pages. Check convention

Also check nelanco-claude on thread specific to this work. See if you can carry on from there


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me gather the full context — the page itself, the SunMint tree QR linking plan, the nelanco-claude box docs, and how other dapp pages are structured.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Gary is asking me to (1) standardize the UX of `link_tree_planting.html` to match other dapp pages, and (2) check what the nelanco-claude box did on this thread and carry on from there. Let me gather the conventions and any nelanco-claude handoffs.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me look at the dapp_beta repo structure and the reference pages for UX convention (review_queue.html is the gating pattern reference), plus check what nelanco-claude has on this thread.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me dig into what nelanco-claude has been working on related to this — checking CONTEXT_UPDATES and the handoffs repo.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me look at the rest of the current page, recent dapp_beta PRs, and the manifest/advisory entries about this work.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me get the full current page (the JS part) and the reference convention from a page that was already conformed (report_contribution.html / review_queue.html header pattern).


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me get the final chunk of the page's JS so I fully understand the current implementation.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The nested artifacts are truncating. Let me fetch the raw file directly from GitHub to see the full JS.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The tool results keep nesting/truncating. Let me fetch the file directly to disk on the box and read it locally.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The file keeps truncating at ~8K. Let me read the JS portion directly via sed on the box.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me read the file in chunks via sed to avoid truncation.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Now let me check the convention docs and what nelanco-claude did on this thread (11596).


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me see the rest of the SUNMINT plan (state/UAT), the tail of the page JS, and a recently-conformed page for the convention reference.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The artifacts keep nesting. Let me pull the plan file locally and grep the key sections.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me check the agent_handoffs repo contents, review_queue's branded header pattern (PR #54/#55 set the convention), and menu.js.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me examine the conformed pages (review_queue, report_contribution) — body/header/footer conventions — and check the nelanco-claude box for related work.


### 🧑 Governor

[TURN DIRECTIVE] You have used 23 of 30 tool rounds and are approaching the per-turn limit. Stop calling tools now and converge: summarize what you found, what (if anything) is still blocking, and end with a 'RESUME HERE' pointer so the next turn can continue. Start no new multi-step work — land a clean, resumable answer in your next message.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Converging now — here's where things stand.

## What I found

**1. The page vs. the DApp convention**

`dapp_beta/link_tree_planting.html` (merged via dapp_beta #62 as plan PR7) is functional but **hand-rolled and out of convention**:

| Aspect | Current page | DApp convention (review_queue.html, conformed in PRs #54/#55) |
|---|---|---|
| Palette | Hardcoded hex (`#f5f5f5`, `#2e7d32`, `#e2e2e2`) | `:root` CSS vars — Saffron Monk: `--bg #f5f5f5`, `--surface #fff`, `--border #e2e2e2`, `--accent #166534`, `--radius 8px` |
| Header | Plain `<h1>`, no logo, no auth badge | Centered logo `<img id="logo" height="200px" …/>` + `status-badge` (governor green / readonly muted) |
| Footer | None | `js/dapp_footer_links.js?v=1` |
| Buttons | One-off `#link_button` style | `.btn` + `.btn-approve/.btn-skip/.btn-reject`, hover opacity, disabled state |
| Gating | `Permissions.requireRole('tree_planting.link')` ✅ (this is the *modern* pattern — plan explicitly wanted this over review_queue's older manual `checkAuth()`) | same permissions.js pattern |
| Box model | `body{margin:1rem;padding:1rem}` without `*{box-sizing}` reset | `*{box-sizing:border-box;margin:0;padding:0}`, `body{min-height:100vh;padding:1rem}` |

So the fix is a **presentation-layer restyle only** — keep all the working JS (localStorage key/endpoint, `EdgarPayloadHelper` signing, dual-list selection), swap the CSS to the shared variable convention, add the logo header + auth badge + footer.

**2. nelanco-claude on this thread**

- `check_handoffs()`: only a **Bionpact→Sophia UAT test** (agent-handoff protocol live test) — unrelated to this page.
- No file in agentic_ai_context references thread `11596`; the handoff manifest has no row for it; `agent_handoffs` repo isn't listable from here (private, 404 via contents API without creds).
- **The real "carry-on" point**: the SunMint→QR linking roadmap (`plans/SUNMINT_TREE_QR_LINKING_PLAN.md`) — authored by Claude Anthropic on the nelanco-claude box — shows **PR2–PR8 all built & merged** (dapp_beta #62 = this page, treasury-cache #11 = `tree_planting.link` permission, tokenomics #392 = schema/API docs). Status table: UAT is the only **unchecked** row, and §5 is the **always-stop gate** (human validates on beta before real owner emails).

## What's blocking

Nothing structural — just the turn limit. I have the full page file locally at `/tmp/link_tree_planting.html` and the reference `review_queue.html` at `/tmp/review_queue.html`, so the next turn can diff-and-edit without re-fetching.

## RESUME HERE

**Next turn:** open a PR in `dapp_beta` that restyles `link_tree_planting.html` to the shared convention — `:root` Saffron Monk variables, logo + auth `status-badge` header, `.btn`-class button, `dapp_footer_links.js` footer — **without touching the JS logic**. Then report to Gary for review on beta (this is a beta repo; prod promotion stays governor-only). After merge, the remaining roadmap item is **UAT per §5 of SUNMINT_TREE_QR_LINKING_PLAN.md** (needs a non-governor identity check + a low-stakes real SOLD QR / test owner email).
