 You are speaking with Gary Teh. When they say 'I', 'me', or 'my', they mean Gary Teh.]

[Telegram context: chat_id=-1003919341801, thread_id=4439] Can you help check if https://edgar.truesight.me/ landing page is sitting in dao_protocol repo or sentiment_importer repo


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me check both repos to find where the Edgar landing page lives.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me look at the routes and the DAO controller to see what serves the root path.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The default branch isn't `main`. Let me check what branches exist.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Found it. Let me read the routes and the landing page view to confirm.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Now let me also check the `dao_protocol` repo for comparison.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Here's the answer:

**The `https://edgar.truesight.me/` landing page lives in the `sentiment_importer` repo**, not `dao_protocol`.

Evidence:
- **Routes** (`config/routes.rb`): The root path is `root :to => 'static_pages#smart_rediect'` (note the typo — "rediect" not "redirect")
- **View**: `app/views/static_pages/landing_page.html.erb` — it's a market overview dashboard with date navigation, period selectors, and a Gemini-powered market analysis card
- The `dao_protocol` repo has no landing page views at all — it's a FastAPI server (port 8010) that handles different concerns

The landing page is essentially a **market overview dashboard** — it shows market snapshot cards, date navigation, period selectors, and an AI-generated market analysis section. It's a Rails app (the `sentiment_importer` / Edgar Rails backend on `seni_ror`).

Want me to check anything about the Nginx config that routes `edgar.truesight.me` to the Rails app?
