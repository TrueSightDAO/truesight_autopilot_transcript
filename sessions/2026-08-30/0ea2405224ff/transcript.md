### 🧑 Governor

[observed, not directed at you — Nobody Will not DM you]: Jedielcio brought us to this plot of land where his family resides. He has offered to allow tree planting on this plot.

what doe you think is the best way to document this given what you know about the tech ecosystem we have in place? I will also include the videos

There are two plots actually the one near the house where we are at and the one where therre are 5 hectares owned by his family.

I will upload the images and videos and you let me know what you think

[observed, not directed at you — Nobody Will not DM you]: plot 1 information is at 

~/rancho_maranta_plot_1.zip
~/rancho_maranta_plot_2.zip

perhaps extract the latitude and longitudes embedded within each plot? 

I think the movie files end up might be very big, you need to figure out how to be smart and not process all the movie files frame by frame to get what we need. 

I think the most important thing is to figure out how to inform which plots to display for the impact map section of 

https://beta.truesight.me/sunmint.html

Have a brief look at the documents, dont spent too much tokens analyzing the contents therein and let me know your thoughts on how to proceed

### 🤖 Autopilot

The impact map lives in truesight_me_beta (PR #319 "SunMint impact map V1 — see our trees from space (Leaflet + Sentinel-2)"). Let me look at how it's built, and pull GPS from the HEICs.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Plot 1 GPS extracted — and it matches the TREE PLANTING EVENT lat/lon from the advisory snapshot (-3.29609, -52.58318). Now plot 2 + the MOVs, and the runbook for how planting events feed the map.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The MOVs trace a walking path — that's a goldmine for mapping the plot boundary. Let me finish the plot 2 list and find the impact map implementation.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me see the impact map section of sunmint.html — how it feeds the map data.


### 🤖 Autopilot

The artifact paging is getting nested. Let me pull the impact map section directly from the repo with targeted greps.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Now let me see the map's PILOT_CENTER, the impact registry data, and how the sunmint repo's `trees/index.geojson` is structured.


### 🤖 Autopilot

Let me do one final quick check — the sunmint repo structure and how the map handles bounds (whether it auto-fits to markers).


### 🤖 Autopilot

Brief look done — here's what I found and my recommendation.

## What's in the zips (GPS extracted — no video frame processing needed)

Key insight on the "don't process frames" ask: **iPhone MOVs carry GPS in the container metadata**, so `exiftool` reads the walk track instantly without decoding a single frame. HEICs too. Extraction for both plots is fully done:

| | Plot 1 (house) | Plot 2 (family, ~5 ha) |
|---|---|---|
| Photos (HEIC) | 4, clustered at **-3.29610, -52.58316** (matches the TREE PLANTING EVENT on the ledger: -3.29609, -52.58318 ✓) | 6, spanning **-3.2935 to -3.2938, -52.5773 to -52.5785** |
| Videos (MOV) | 3 short clips (~27s total) at same spot | **23 clips (16:31–16:49) tracing a walking path** around the plot — the GPS track gives you a real boundary approximation |
| Track span | ~35 m | ~145 m N–S × ~200 m E–W ≈ **2.9 ha walked** (less than the claimed 5 ha → walk didn't cover the full boundary) |

## How the impact map actually works (sunmint.html, beta)

- It's **marker-driven**: fetches `sunmint/trees/index.geojson` (19 Points: tree_id, species, status) and drops green dots. No polygons, no plots concept yet.
- `PILOT_CENTER = [-27.44, -48.50]` — that's **Florianópolis**, despite the comment saying "Altamira region". Wrong center, and a few tree entries even have junk coords (one in Oregon). So the map currently doesn't show your pilot area at all.
- There's already a `sunmint/satellite/manifest.json` + Sentinel-2 history strip infra.

## My recommended approach

1. **Build a plots registry mirroring the trees one**: `sunmint/plots/index.geojson` — Polygon features for Plot 1 + Plot 2 with metadata (farm "Rancho Maranta", family Jedielcio, hectares, status, photo refs). Same architecture the map already consumes → tiny change to render.
2. **Don't hand-draw Plot 2's polygon from the walk.** Get the authoritative boundary: Jedielcio's **CAR (Cadastro Ambiental Rural)** or INCRA registration gives an exact polygon, or have him walk the true boundary with any GPS-track app (~10 min). Use the walk-track hull as a labeled "approximate" stopgap.
3. **Map PR (truesight_me_beta)**: fix PILOT_CENTER to the real area (~-3.2, -52.2), load plots + draw shaded polygons, auto-fit bounds, cluster tree markers by plot, show farm/family in the popup. Also clean the junk tree coords.
4. **Registry + ledger**: add the farm to the Farms Registry and anchor it with a geo-located event (a TREE PLANTING EVENT already exists at Plot 1 — the pattern is proven). Videos stay **out of git** (Plot 2 is 562 MB) — store as raw-footage release/Drive, reference URLs; only thumbnails + GPS track go in the registry.
5. **Satellite layer**: once plots have polygons, the existing Sentinel-2 history strip makes this a proper "see our plots from space" verification story.

Media handling: HEICs are small enough to compress into the sunmint repo; the MOVs should never be committed — they're evidence, not registry data.

Want me to proceed? Suggested order: (a) extract everything to a `plots/index.geojson` draft PR on `sunmint`, (b) the map PR on `truesight_me_beta`, (c) farm registration + ledger event. Say the word and I'll start with (a), and I'll hold the CAR/boundary question as a follow-up for Jedielcio.
